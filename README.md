# Semantic Markup

## Description:

Horieson has a simple and intuitive website, however, it is not built so that people with disabilites can navigate within it. My task was to make this website so that it meets accessibility standards, without changing the way the website is designed. The stylesheet was also decluttered and cleaned. By learning semantic HTML, I was able to change the code and make sure it meets accessibility standards. At the same time, the code looks cleaner and everyone can make sense of it. 



## Installation

No installation is required. 



## Usage

Insert URL here

To test the accessibility of the website: Copy and paste the URL into any search engine and activate voiceover on your computer.
